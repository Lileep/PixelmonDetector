# Pixelmon Detector

A safe, efficient, lightweight and server owner friendly high version Pixel Radar.

This mod is based on many previous works and has been optimized in several aspects. Regardless of whether the previous Radar(like Pixelmon Radar, Poke Radar) creators were good or not, Lileep will treat this mod with as much respect as possible.

Anyway, enjoy it! :>

# Features

* Lightweight
* Quick and efficient
* Enhanced custom searching
* Highly localization support
* Server config reading first

**Note: This mod has no map related funtions. If you wish to show pokemon sprites(icons) on map mods like JourneyMap, you may need [the tutorial of showing Pixelmon sprites on JourneyMap mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelmonMod/comments/ftb1x3/how_to_get_journeymap_to_show_pixelmon_icons) or google "show pixelmon sprites on maps". They have more powerful abilities of showing fancy Pixelmon sprites on maps than a Lileep can do.**

# Download

Although you can download this mod in the releases page, Lileep would appreciate it if you could click the adfoc.us download button above :)

# Instructions

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Lileep/PixelmonDetector/wiki) in this repo to get more info! :>

# For server owners

By default, Pixelmon Detector can work in servers with only clients installed.

I haven't implemented any anti anti-cheat measures in this mod, so if you are a server owner and don't want players in your server to use Pixelmon Detector, here are 2 ways you can choose:

**1. Simply ban this mod with mod id `pixelmondetector` by mod restriction plugins/mods.**

**2. Install Pixelmon Detector on your server. It will do nothing but only generate a config under your server config folder. With this config, you can set the behaviors of players' Pixelmon Detector. All players logging into your server will load the server config first before joining rather than loading their client one.**

A nice guy told me that many people prefer to use afdian, so I created an account there and post the same thing with a translation from google.
